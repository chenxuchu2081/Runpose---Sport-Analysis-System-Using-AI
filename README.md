# Runpose-Sport-Analysis-System-Using-AI
## Final Year Project

### Project Description
> This application is related to health and  sport, for user use their mobile phone to scan their skeleton using artificial intelligence. And the system will provide importing measurement data for professional running. This system will be very convenient to coach and professional athletes. They can improve athletes’ performance from the analysis. With the power AI, everything can be done by just an ordinary smartphone and the phone’s camera without support of other devices.
